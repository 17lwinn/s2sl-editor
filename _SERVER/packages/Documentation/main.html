  <p>Think Microsoft Windows or macOS, but in your browser.</p>
  <h2>I found a bug. Where do I report it?</h2>

  <h2>How do I install auroraOS on my own server?</h2>
  <p>Currently, there isn't an automated installer. However, you can install it manually by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/soupy-developer/auroraOS">git repository</a> and running <b>npm i</b> in the _SERVER directory. Then, run _SERVER/server.js. After that, you can visit localhost:[the port, default is 3000] or configure it.</p>
