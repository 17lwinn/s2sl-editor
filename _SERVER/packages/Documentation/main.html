  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <p>Before we begin, take a look at the FAQ.</p>
  <h2>What is auroraOS?</h2>
  <p>Think Microsoft Windows or macOS, but in your browser.</p>
  <h2>I found a bug. Where do I report it?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/soupy-developer/auroraOS/issues">https://github.com/soupy-developer/auroraOS/issues.</a></p>
  <h2>How do I install auroraOS on my own server?</h2>
  <p>Currently, there isn't an automated installer. However, you can install it manually by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/soupy-developer/auroraOS">git repository</a> and running <b>npm i</b> in the _SERVER directory. Then, run _SERVER/server.js. After that, you can visit localhost:[the port, default is 3000] or configure it.</p>
  
  <h1>Important Information</h1>
  <p>This section includes information about auroraOS and how it works.</p>

  <p>As you can see, the server-side core only serves files and packages. As of now, packages only run on the client.</p>
  <h2>File Structure</h2>
  <pre>
    LICENSE                  Obvious reasons
    core.js                  Client core script
    default.css              Base css for themes
    index.html               Actual HTML file
    package.json             NPM package list
    wallpaper.webp           Default wallpaper
    .gitignore, README.md    Can be removed
    [All other files]        Important
    _SERVER/                 Server things
        server.js            Server core script
        themes/              Themes (.css files) go here
        packages/            Packages go here
          samplePackage/     Packages are stored as directories
            app.js           Main script, run on package start
            icon.webp        Package icon (only required if package is an app)
            info.json        Package information
            main.html        Main window (only required if package is an app/not embedded into package)
        home/                Main filesystem directory</pre>
  <h2>Compatibility</h2>
  <p>The client can run in most modern browsers. It fails to run in Internet Explorer and non-Chromium versions of Edge.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the server requires Node 8 or later. It uses Express to serve auroraOS.</p>
  <h2>Packages</h2>
  <p>auroraOS is a package-based system. Everything that is not part of the core system, i.e. the file browser, settings app, calculator, and more, is a package. To install a package, all you have to do is move the package directory into <b>_SERVER/packages/</b>.</p>
  
  <h1>API Reference</h1>
  <p>All packages must be wrapped in either <pre>;(async function(){   YOUR CODE HERE   })()</pre> or <pre>;(function(){   YOUR CODE HERE   })()</pre></p><br>
  
  <pre>os.runningPackages[document.currentScript.id];</pre>
  <p>Returns the process itself.</p><br>
  
  <pre>[PACKAGE].createWindow(window HTML, options)</pre>
  <p>Creates a window. <b>options</b> is optional, and accepts an object. Valid options are: resizable (bool), and startingDimensions (array consisting of two numbers, width and height).</p><br>
  
  <pre>[PACKAGE].resource(file name)</pre>
  <p>Returns a file in base64 form. It looks in the package directory, e.g. passing <b>thing.txt</b> would return <b>_SERVER/packages/yourPackage/thing.txt</b>.</p><br>
  
  <pre>os.alert(message, title, [PACKAGE WINDOW], callback function)</pre>
  <p>Shows an alert with the message and title. If the user clicks OK, the callback function is run.</p><br>
  
  <pre>os.prompt(message, title, [PACKAGE WINDOW], callback function, show text box)</pre>
  <p>Shows a prompt with the message and title. If the user clicks OK, the callback function is run with the text entered passed as argument 1.</p><br>
  
  <pre>[WINDOW].minimize()</pre>
  <p>Minimizes the window.</p><br>
  
  <pre>[WINDOW].maximize()</pre>
  <p>Maximizes the window.</p><br>
  
  <pre>[WINDOW].close()</pre>
  <p>Closes the window. If the package is defined as an application and the last window is closed, the package automatically stops.</p><br>
  
  <pre>[WINDOW].edit(contents)</pre>
  <p>Edits the window.</p><br>
