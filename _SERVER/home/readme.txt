Hi!
Welcome to auroraOS
( https://github.com/soupy-developer/auroraOS )
This was just a file system test
Mess Around and Have Found
You can also check out some themes in the Settings

- Most functions in auroraOS are avaible through context menus ( Just Right-Click with your mouse )

- The Windows 10 Theme doesn't work yet
